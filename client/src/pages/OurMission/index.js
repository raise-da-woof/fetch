            <p>
                We all know that socializing your dog is not only healthy for its mental,
                emotional, and physical health, but for its overall life experience. But
                we know that socializing your dog can be difficult, along with finding
                companions that match your dogs’ age, size, temperament, and overall
                characteristics. That is why Fetch was created. Fetch is an establishment
                where all dog owners of any kind can come to, to find their dog a loving playmate.
                But it couldn’t just be any dog matching enterprise, so we created a Tinder for dogs!
                When you enter our site each dog has a profile created specifically for them showcasing
                everything about them; even with a little bio down below to get to know where they like
                to play! We wanted the overall experience to be fun and exciting and who doesn’t like
                seeing a bunch of adorable dogs! We hope you find your dogs' next best friend. Happy Swiping!
